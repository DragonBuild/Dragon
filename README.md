# DragonBuild

## Disclaimer

The DragonBuild build system is fairly young, and you should not rely on it for your projects, yet.

## Quick Start

```
dragon [commands]

Building -=-=-
  d|do - Build and Install
  c|clean - recompile, link, and package your project
  b|build|make - compile, link, and package your project
  r|release - Load DragonRelease file over the DragonMake one
  rl|relink - Re-link the package regardless of changes

Installation -=-=-
  s|device - Set build device IP/Port
  i|install - Install to build device
  rs|respring - Respring the current build device
  dr|devicerun - Run anything after this flag on device
  
```

[Full List Of Commands](#dragonbuild-commands)

# Installing DragonBuild

Paste the following into terminal:

`bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DragonBuild/installer/master/install.sh)`

# Setting up your project for DragonBuild

## DragonMake

A single-file tweak can be built with the following 'DragonMake' file.

```
---
name: MyTweak
icmd: sbreload

MyTweak:
  type: tweak
  files:
    - Tweak.xm
```

### DragonMake Syntax

DragonMake follows yaml syntax. Strings dont typically need to be wrapped in `""`, although wildcards do.

For str variables, you can use bash syntax to evaluate a command with `$$(command args)`

You can also refer to environment variables with `$$VARNAME`

Wildcards:  
  `"*.[extension]"` is the syntax. `**` and other globbing rules are applied. Type `ls <your wildcard here>` to get an idea. 
  `"**/*.m"` for example will find all .m files in the current directory *and subdirectories*

### DragonMake Format

This should serve as a guideline for how a project should be laid out. You can declare as many projects as you want, it's all going to be crammed into the same deb. 

"ModuleName" represents a module, here. Typically this is "TweakName" or "TweakNamePrefs", or something along those lines.

```yaml
---
# This represents the overall project name. 
name: TweakName
icmd: sbreload

# Variables declared here apply to all modules.
all:
  targetvers: 11.0
  archs:
    - arm64
    - arm64e

# This represents a Tweak .dylib and .plist. 
ModuleName:
    type: tweak
    # A list of logos files. See variables section for more info. 
    logos_files:
        - "*.xm"
        
# Now for preferences!
AnotherModuleName:
    # Specify the directory, since it's a subproject
    dir: nameprefs
    # Tell dragon that it's a bundle
    type: prefs
    # You can specify files from anywhere in your tweak, or use directory specific wildcards
    objc_files:
        - BlahRootListController.m
        - ACellYouUse.m
        - ../SomeFileFromYourMainTweak.m
        
# If you have a tweak subproject that, for example, hooks another process, you can compile it into the same deb
# This is the minimal amount of info you can provide and have your project compile. 
ASubModuleName:
    dir: othertweak
    type: tweak
    files:
        - othertweak/Tweak.xm    
```

# DragonBuild Commands

All (most) of these can be combined and ran at the same time, if needed.

`dragon update` will update your dragonbuild installation to the latest version.

`dragon -h` outputs the following:

# Endgame for this project

The ultimate hope for this project is that the major alternative, theos, sees the same improvements this project has. It's unlikely it'll ever become as popular as theos, but the hope is that it can instead inspire the maintainers there into "catching up."

# Current State

DragonBuild is currently "mildly stable." It'll have some bumps, especially on linux.

DragonBuild also recently went through a major rewrite of the generator. As I only have one PC to test on, what works for me may not work on your machine. I'm always willing to get in touch and debug your issues.

# Credits

@Siguza, for writing ./bin/tbdump, the tool used to symbolicate libraries that can be compiled for this.

@sbinger, for patiently helping me add arm64e support to tbdump (turns out its easy when you know what you're doing :))

@theos, and the badass team there, who created a good amount of the resources this project depends on, and who have all been a major help in guiding the way for this project. This wouldn't exist without theos, and without the great people behind it.
